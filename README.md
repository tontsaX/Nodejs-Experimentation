# Nodejs-Experimentation
My dive into Node.js and experimenting with the framework.

This experimentation project contains login, logout and register handling with Express Passport and a real time chat made with Socket.io.
This project is made by merging multiple web tutorials. My idea is to make a platform where two clients can play the Royal Game of Ur in real time.

Right now project's Urls are a mess, because I've been more of trying out database and login control and socket.io.
