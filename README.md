# Nodejs-Experimentation
My dive into Node.js and experimenting with the framework.

My idea is to make a page where two players can play the Royal Game of Ur in real time. 

[Link to start a game of Game of Ur on my Heroku page.](https://ancient-caverns-95141.herokuapp.com/game-of-ur "Game of Ur")
<br>No gameplay yet.
