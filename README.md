# Nodejs-Historic-Games
My dive into Node.js and experimenting with the framework.

My idea is to make a site where you can play the Royal Game of Ur in real time and other historic games alone or with a friend. Time period doesn't matter. 

[Link to start a game of Game of Ur on my Heroku page.](https://ancient-caverns-95141.herokuapp.com/game-of-ur "Game of Ur") Atm there's gameplay for one of the players only.
