# Nodejs-Experimentation
My dive into Node.js and experimenting with the framework.

This experimentation project contains login, logout and register handling with Express Passport and a real time chat made with Socket.io.
This project is made by merging multiple web tutorials. My idea is to make a platform where two clients can play the Royal Game of Ur in real time.
