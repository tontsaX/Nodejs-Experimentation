# Nodejs-Experimentation
My dive into Node.js and experimenting with the framework.

This experimentation project contains login, logout and register handling with Express Passport and a real time chat made with Socket.io.
This project is made by merging multiple web tutorials. My idea is to make a platform where two clients can play the Royal Game of Ur in real time. 

[Link to the project's login page on Heroku](https://ancient-caverns-95141.herokuapp.com/logintuto/users/login "My Heroku App"). If you want to try out the login system, go to [the register page](https://ancient-caverns-95141.herokuapp.com/logintuto/users/register) and create user. After trying out the app, please delete the created user from the [the dashboard page](https://ancient-caverns-95141.herokuapp.com/logintuto/users/kissakala/dashboard) while logged in. Thank you very much for your interest and cooperation.
Right now project's Urls are a mess, because I've been more of trying out database and login control and socket.io.
